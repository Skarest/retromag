		<text>The GameCube is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on 14 September 2001. It is the successor to the Nintendo 64 (N64). As a sixth-generation console, the GameCube primarily competed with the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Nintendo began developing the GameCube in 1998 after entering a partnership with ArtX to design a graphics processing unit. The console was formally announced under the codename "Dolphin" the following year, and was released in 2001 as the GameCube. It is Nintendo's first console to use optical discs instead of ROM cartridges, supplemented by writable memory cards for saved games. Throughout the mid 2000s, GameCube hardware sales remained far behind its direct competitor the PlayStation 2, and slightly behind the Xbox. The console's family-friendly appeal and lack of support from certain third-party developers skewed the GameCube toward a younger market, which was a minority of the gaming population during the sixth generation.</text>
